# Pok√©mon Spark Yellow

Built using [pret's disassembly][1] of Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green

Modification of Pokemon Fire Red that aims to recreate Pokemon Yellow but in the Gen 3 style with some QoL updates

# Installation instructions:

Use [FLIPS][2] to patch the .BPS file onto a clean Pokemon Fire Red ROM (the option will appear as "Apply Patch"). From there, FLIPS will ask you for the clean unmodified ROM and THEN the patch (.BPS) file.

Changelog:
----------

- Your starter is now Pikachu and your rival has Eevee
- Eevee now evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon by sun and moon stone respectively
- Pikachu now learns iron tail at level 13 similar to how Charmander got Metal Claw
- Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle can now be received from NPCs similar to Yellow
    - Bulbasaur: lead Pokemon must have at least 150 frienship
    - Charmander: received for free
    - Squirtle: received once Thunder Badge is obtained
    - each starter is holding their type-boosting item and is level 15
- TMs are infinite use
    - HMs are forgettable
- Wild Pikachu event in Pallet Town
- Wild Pokemon are matched with Yellow
    - slight adjustments to make Pokedex completion possible

- Rivals team changes based on results of early game battles
