# Pok√©mon Spark Yellow

Built using [pret's disassembly][1] of Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green

Modification of Pokemon Fire Red that aims to recreate Pokemon Yellow but in the Gen 3 style with some QoL updates

# Installation instructions:

Use [FLIPS][2] to patch the .BPS file onto a clean Pokemon Fire Red ROM (the option will appear as "Apply Patch"). From there, FLIPS will ask you for the clean unmodified ROM and THEN the patch (.BPS) file.

Changelog:
----------

- Physical Special Split
- Your starter is now Pikachu and your rival has Eevee
- Eevee now evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon by sun and moon stone respectively
- Pikachu now learns iron tail at level 13 to make Brock a bit easier!
- Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle can now be received from NPCs similar to Yellow
- TMs are infinite use!
- Wild Pikachu event in Pallet Town
- change moves and nickname options from party menu!

To-Do:
------

- clean up Pikachu event (Prof. Oak instead of old man)
- Rival changing teams dependent on results of early game battles
