# Pok√©mon Spark Yellow

Built using [pret's disassembly][1] of Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green

Modification of Pokemon Fire Red that aims to recreate Pokemon Yellow but in the Gen 3 style with some QoL updates

Changelog:
----------

- Physical Special Split
- Your starter is now Pikachu and your rival has Eevee
- Eevee now evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon by sun and moon stone respectively
- Pikachu now learns iron tail at level 13 to make Brock a bit easier!
- Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle can now be received from NPCs similar to Yellow
- TMs are infinite use!

To-Do:
------

- Wild Pikachu event at start of game
- HMs deletable
- Rival changing teams dependent on results of early game battles

## Thank you to 00mn00 (split icons) for help in implementation!
